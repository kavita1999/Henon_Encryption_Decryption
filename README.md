# REPORT 

* Initially the idea was to use two map functions one after the another but only one map is implemented. Addition of another map functions is made easy as the encryption (based on single map) is coded separately in a different file. And the UI is also made such that another buttons with their respective map functions can be added easily. 

## Image-Encryption-Using-Chaotic-Henon-Map
* Image Encryption using Henon Map. 
* Henon key values used are x=0.1,y=0.1

## RESULTS PLACED IN THE SCREENSHOTS FOLDER

## LIBRARIES NEEDED 
* Python3 
* PIL
* tkinter
* Some inbuilt

## Steps to Encrypt
* Run Encryption.py for encrypting an image
* Place the image (ztest.bmp) path under the select image label.
* Click on Encrypt using Henon map.
* Full image file path appears in the text box next to the buttons.

## Steps to Decrypt
* Run Decryption.py for decrypting an image.
* Place the Encrypted image (After you run the Encryption.py you'll get an image) path under the select image label.
* Click on Decryption using Henon map.
* Full image file path appears in the text box next to the buttons.
